_README INCOMPLETE - TO BE FINISHED_

<h1>BookFinder App</h1>

For my milestone two project as part of the Code Institute's Full stack developer programme, I have built a book searching application, the BookFinder app. The BookFinder app has been built using the Google Books API. The BookFinder app allows you to search Google Books entire catalogue of books. It will also allow you to read any book available via the Google Books API, using the Embedded Viewer API.

<h2>UX</h2>
My website is geared towards book lovers and those that love to read. The purpose of my website is two-fold and it can be used for both purposes in tandem, or just one purpose on its own. The first purpose of the app is to give the end user the ability to search for a book based on author, title or subject, utilising the Google Books API search functionality. And the second purpose is to allow the end user to read that book, utlilising the Google Books Embedded Viewer API. 

_In particular, as part of this section we recommend that you provide a list of User Stories, with the following general structure:_

_This section is also where you would share links to any wireframes, mockups, diagrams etc. that you created as part of the design process. These files should themselves either be included as a pdf file in the project itself (in an separate directory), or just hosted elsewhere online and can be in any format that is viewable inside the browser.

_Features
_In this section, you should go over the different parts of your project, and describe each in a sentence or so.

_Existing Features
_Feature 1 - allows users X to achieve Y, by having them fill out Z
...
_For some/all of your features, you may choose to reference the specific project files that implement them, although this is entirely optional.

_In addition, you may also use this section to discuss plans for additional features to be implemented in the future:

_Features Left to Implement
_Another feature idea
_Technologies Used
_In this section, you should mention all of the languages, frameworks, libraries, and any other tools that you have used to construct this project. For each, provide its name, a link to its official site and a short sentence of why it was used.

_JQuery
The project uses JQuery to simplify DOM manipulation.
Testing
In this section, you need to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well. Essentially, in this part you will want to go over all of your user stories from the UX section and ensure that they all work as intended, with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.

_Whenever it is feasible, prefer to automate your tests, and if you've done so, provide a brief explanation of your approach, link to the test file(s) and explain how to run them.

_For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:

_Contact form:
Go to the "Contact Us" page
Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.
In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

_You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

_If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.

_Deployment
This section should describe the process you went through to deploy the project to a hosting platform (e.g. GitHub Pages or Heroku).

_In particular, you should provide all details of the differences between the deployed version and the development version, if any, including:

_Different values for environment variables (Heroku Config Vars)?
Different configuration files?
Separate git branch?
In addition, if it is not obvious, you should also describe how to run your code locally.
